        <h2>A Brief History of Agrigento, Sicily</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px">Agrigento was inherited by the Romans from the Greeks who founded it in 581 BC. It was originally named Akragas by the Greeks and kept the name with the Romans until it was occupied by Arabs in 210 BC and changed it to Girgenti. The Norman invaders
            later combined the two names together thus giving it the name Agrigento. Frederic II expelled the Norman invaders in the thirteenth century. Its architecture style bears witness to its Greek Byzantine, Latin and Norman heritage to this day.
            It is rich with history and beauty. Even the famous Italian writer Luigi Pirandello was born there. It remains a feast of history even to this day.</p>
